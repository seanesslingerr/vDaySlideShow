        <p>
            I know I coulddd have done a card. But I wanted to change things up a bit! 
            I might have not done the best job but I made this for you to look back on and appreciate!
            We can also add to it and make it more! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you so much Megan. You are the sun that makes me shine and I am the moon that makes you glow! I am so 
            greateful to have you in my life, because there is no one I care about like you. You make waking up in the 
            morning a blessing everyday. You fill me with energy and passion. Loving you is a gift I am grateful to have.
        </p>
